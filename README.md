## About Me

I am a 12 year old girl looking for a job in mother's helping. I would be hapy to help wth chores around the house, or keep an eye on and entertain children under the age of nine. 

I have three younder brothers, and I am a peer medator at school, so I know how to deal with arguments and calm down upset children. I can help with of do dishes, cooking, laundry, yard work or just general cleaning. I have experience with kids that have sensory difficulties.
